<!--Looks like you're ready to get making with Pitt Fuego Webtext Generator. Good luck. Let's remember a few basic things:

1. If you haven't worked through one of our Pitt Fuego introductory tools (Electrate Fuego or I Am...A Project in Becoming), please do so. These programs will give you the basic skills to use this webtext generator.
2. Add content from code repository at the bottom of this file. Copy and paste from <div> to </div>.
3. Pay attention to file management - keep your asset names simple or use camel case.
4. Make sure your code matches your asset/file type. Code is case sensitive,
5. Describe all images and clearly label links and buttons for accessibility  purposes.
6. Consult w3.org when your code needs to do more than it does.
7. Control Z, Control Z, Control Z...
8. Publish, share, spread the Fuego!-->

<h2>what is bias?</h2>
  <h3>According to Merriam-Webster, bias, when used as a noun, can mean an inclination of temperament, outlook, or prejudice. Though some bias is extremely apparent, like in hate-based organizations or crimes, these judgements can be unconscious or unknown to us when we exert or think them. This can be extremely harmful at times, however, these can be avoided if you become aware of them and make an effort to remove them from your thoughts or actions.</h3>
